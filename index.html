      <div id="about-me">
        <p>I’m a multifunctional designer interested in radical ideas that strike the balance between functionality and aesthetics. Living half my life in Lebanon and in the States, I always have the outsider’s view paired with the insider’s knowledge. I aim to preserve that with every project I work on. </p>
        <p>I recently graduated with a Masters in Communication Design from Parsons School of Design in New York City. During my graduate career, I aimed to ameliorate my knowledge in digital strategies by using my previous extensive experience in print. Prior to attending Parsons School of Design, I obtained a Bachelors in Graphic Design from the America University of Beirut. Wherever I travel, my versatile life near the beaches of California, to the Appalachians of West Virginia, up the elegant streets of Washington DC, and most importantly in the war-torn alleys of Beirut spark my creativity and ongoing pursuit for purposeful design.  </p>

      <div class="about-me"> 
        <p> I'm a multifunctional designer interested in the balance between purposefulness and aesthetics when it comes to my work. I lived the first half of my life in the States, and the other half as a native in Lebanon. Having resided in such contrasting areas aided me in attaining two distinct methods of approaching design, which ultimately is an advantage I aim to make the most of. </p>
        <p> I recently graduated as an honors student from Parsons School of Design, with a Masters in Communication Design. I kept my extensive knowledge of print in mind during my graduate career and aimed to achieve the same level of expertise for web design. Prior to attending school in New York, I obtained a Bachelors in Graphic Design from the America University of Beirut. Wherever I live, I'm able to adjust being in a new environment and let my unfamiliar surroundings inspire my creativity;  but my home and roots are always kept in my mind and most importantly- my heart. </p>
