      <div id="about-me">
        <p> I'm a multifunctional designer interested in the balance between purposefulness and aesthetics when it comes to my work. I lived the first half of my life in the States, and the other half as a native in Lebanon. Living in such contrasting areas allowed me to attain two distinct methods of approaching design, which ultimately is an advantage I aim to make the most of. </p>
        <p> I recently graduated as an honors student from Parsons School of Design, with a Masters in Communication Design. I kept my extensive knowledge of print in mind during my graduate career and aimed to achieve the same level of expertise for web design. Prior to attending school in New York, I obtained a Bachelors in Graphic Design from the America University of Beirut. Wherever I live, I'm able to adjust being in a new environment and let my unfamiliar surroundings inspire my creativity;  but my home and roots are always kept in my mind and most importantly- my heart. </p>
