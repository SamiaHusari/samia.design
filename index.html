      <div id="about-me">
        <p>I’m a multifunctional designer interested in radical ideas that strike the balance between functionality and aesthetics. Living half my life in Lebanon and in the States, I always have the outsider’s view paired with the insider’s knowledge. I aim to preserve that with every project I work on. </p>
        <p>I recently graduated with a Masters in Communication Design from Parsons School of Design in New York City. During my graduate career, I aimed to ameliorate my knowledge in digital strategies by using my previous extensive experience in print. Prior to attending Parsons School of Design, I obtained a Bachelors in Graphic Design from the America University of Beirut. Wherever I travel, my versatile life near the beaches of California, to the Appalachians of West Virginia, up the elegant streets of Washington DC, and most importantly in the war-torn alleys of Beirut spark my creativity and ongoing pursuit for purposeful design.  </p>
