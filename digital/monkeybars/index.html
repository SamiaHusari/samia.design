      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>
        With technical advancement comes great ethical responsibility.
        The question is as tech companies gain consumer attraction does their ethical responsibility equally heighten?
        MONKEYBARS is aimed to help start-up companies grow and learn how to handle ethical dilemmas along the way.
        Our goal is to have these companies unplug from their technology for a weekend and really get back to their roots.
        The root of why they wanted to start their company to begin.
       </p><p>
        Our brand is MONKEYBARS because the times of climbing the corporate ladder is over.
        Similar to the playground monkey bars, instead of climbing up, we are reaching forward to the next step to grow.
        The conference will allow companies to unwind and enjoy their time learning how to make their company better.

      <h2>App</h2>
      <p>
        Our app has two main phases.
        During the conference, the attendees can experience the talks, workshops and activities.
        After the conference, they can take what they learned and apply it to their every day life.
        Again, we want them to unplug to play.
